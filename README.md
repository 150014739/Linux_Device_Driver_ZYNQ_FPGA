# Linux_Device_Driver_ZYNQ_FPGA
This project shows a full example on how to develop Linux customer device driver for ZYNQ platform (ZCU106 FPGA board).

ZYNQ is a very hot topic, but most of introduction just focuses on how to develop bare-mental program. This project shows one full project demo including customer IP development, Petalinux project development, Linux character device driver development. It could give user the full story on how to develop Linux device driver for customer module. The manual will introduce each step clearly.
1. First develop hardware project in Vivado - Windows Environment;
2. Then develop Linux device driver in Petalinux - Ubuntu Environment;
3. Later develop Linux program by Xilinx SDK - Windows Environment; 

As to the details, please first take a look of "ZCU106_Petalinux_Device_Driver_manual.docx". 
Because of github file size restriction, I only uploaded the source code for Petalinux project. 
You could reproduce the results according the manual.
